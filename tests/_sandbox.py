"""Point every store Vice writes under the user's home at a scratch folder.

Imported first by each test module that reaches the stores. Building a
ShareServer backfills playlists against its own clips folder and saves the
result, so a test that skipped a redirect pruned the real playlists.json
(and could touch real highlights, views and caches). Redirecting at import
covers every test, and test_sandbox.py fails when a new store is added
without a line here.
